      <h2 id="theissue">The Issue</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>30% of the homeless population in Santa Cruz resides in their vehicles. </li>
        <li>Finding a place to park your car and sleep in it can be hard.</li>
        <li>Most of public parking are patrolled by local police.</li>
        <li>Many people are offering their drive-ways for rent on Craigslist, given the housing crisis in the county.</li>
        <li>Government led programs are scarce and do not fit the demand.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="theaudience">The Audience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Our app is aimed to anyone sleeping in their car or van of preference.</li>
        <li>Our app is also used by those who have driveways, parking lots, and other space that are not being used.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="oursolution">Our Solution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Our goal is to make an app to connect people that have an extra parking space they would like to offer with people that need a safe place to park their vehicle overnight for a low cost.</li>
        <li>By having a centralized app, those residing in their vehicles can easily look for a parking spot that they know they will be safe at for any duration that spaces are available.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="apiused">API Used</h2>
      <p>For this application, we used the following APIs :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>FireBase</li>
        <li>FireStore</li>
        <li>MapBox</li>
        <li>GeoBox</li>
      </ul>
